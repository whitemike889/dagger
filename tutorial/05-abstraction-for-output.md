# An abstraction for output

Right now, `HelloWorldCommand` uses `System.out.println()` to write its output.
In the spirit of dependency injection, let's use an abstraction so that we can
remove this _implicit_ dependency on `System.out`. What we'll do is create an
`Outputter` type that does something with text that's written to it. Our default
implementation can still use `System.out.println()`, but this gives us
flexibility to change that later without changing `HelloWorldCommand`. For
example, our tests may use an implementation that adds the string to a
`List<String>` so we can check what was output.

Here's our `Outputter` type:

```java
interface Outputter {
  void output(String output);
}
```

And here's how we'd use it in `HelloWorldCommand`:

```java
private final Outputter outputter;

@Inject
HelloWorldCommand(Outputter outputter) {
  this.outputter = outputter;
}

@Override
public Status handleInput(List<String> input) {
  outputter.output("world!");
  return Status.HANDLED;
}
```

`Outputter` is an `interface`. We could write an implementation of it, give that
class an [`@Inject`] constructor, and then use [`@Binds`] to bind `Outputter` to
that implementation. But `Outputter` is very simple… so simple that we could
even implement it as a lambda or method reference. So instead of doing all that,
let's write a `static` method that just creates and returns an instance of
`Outputter` itself!

```java
@Module
abstract class SystemOutModule {
  @Provides
  static Outputter textOutputter() {
    return System.out::println;
  }
}
```

Here we've created another [`@Module`], but instead of a [`@Binds`] method we
have a [`@Provides`] method. A [`@Provides`] method works a lot like an
[`@Inject`] constructor: here it tells Dagger that when it needs an instance of
`Outputter`, it should _call_ `SystemOutModule.textOutputter()` to get one.

Again, we'll need to add our new module to our component definition to tell
Dagger that it should use that module for our application:

```java
class CommandLineAtm {
  ...

  @Component(modules = {HelloWorldModule.class, SystemOutModule.class})
  interface CommandRouterFactory {
    CommandRouter router();
  }
}
```

Once again, nothing has changed about the _behavior_ of our application, but
it's now easy to write unit tests for our command without it actually writing to
`System.out`.
