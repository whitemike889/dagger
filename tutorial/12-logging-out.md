# Logging out

Our ATM currently supports logging in users, but there's no way to log out.
Let's add support for that.

The logout command is simple. The body of `handleInput()` is just `return
input.isEmpty() ? Result.inputCompleted() : Result.invalid();`.

Configure `LogoutCommand` like we've done for the other commands in
`UserCommandsRouter`.
